TODO:
  CLEANING:
  *  merge all "example" like folder into one.
  *  rename basic as src and move the current src into example
  *  move down the repo => /svn/repo and note /svn/trunk/repo
  *  move experimental or rename it..
  *  what is /svn/jenaclass ?

A better tree would be:

/svn
  tags
    ...
  trunk
    basic -> src
    example -> src/example
    experimental -> ?
    gadget* ?
    javadoc
    jenalib
    jpa ? is that another project ?
    repo -> move to parent
  repo
    ...
  wiki

  JUNIT
  * adding junit test to the project
