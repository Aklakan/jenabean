=== 1. Download jenabean.jar (jena too!)===
jenabean uses Jena which can be downloaded [http://jena.sourceforge.net/downloads.html here]

Create a java bean class and use the @Id annotation to indicate which method has the unique id for this "thing".  We're using a convenience class, RdfBean, to make saving easier and the starting quicker.

{{{
public class Song extends RdfBean<Song> {
	private String composer;
	private Genre genre; 
	private String title;
	
	@Id
	public String getTitle() {
		return title;
	}
}}}
