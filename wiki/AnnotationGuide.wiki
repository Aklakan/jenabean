#summary How to use annotations to persist your objects with jenabean.

= Introduction =
RDF/OWL individuals are identified by a URI.  jenabean annotations are primarily for the purpose of helping you tell jenabean how to map your object to a valid URI.

= Details =
There are three primary annotations:
  * @Namespace - gives a namespace to the java class.
  * @Id - indicates the primary key field of the bean.
  * @RdfProperty - allows you to override the default property naming convention of jenabean.

==Namespace( namespace )==
This annotation is required.  Any object other than a primitive, primitive wrapper, or java.util.Data will be ignored by *jenabean* unless it has this annotation.  This annotation is applied to the class declaration.

{{{
@Namespace("http://example.org#")
public class Foo...

@Namespace("http://my.domain.com/")
public class Bar...

}}}
