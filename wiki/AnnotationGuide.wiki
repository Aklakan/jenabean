#summary How to use annotations to persist your objects with jenabean.

= Introduction =

RDF/OWL individuals are identified by a URI.  jenabean annotations are primarily for the purpose of helping you tell jenabean how to map your object to a valid URI.

= Details =

There are three primary annotations:
  * @Namespace - gives a namespace to the java class.
  * @Id - indicates the primary key field of the bean.
  * @RdfProperty - allows you to override the default property naming convention of jenabean.
