#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

== `@Id` ==
The only annotation required by Jenabean.  Place it on a field or getter method to indicate which property of your bean type is to be used as the beans identity.  If you are working with pre-existing OWL/RDF and are not in control of the URI's, your id type should be `java.net.URI`.  Jenabean supports the following id types (and their primitive equivalent)

  # `java.lang.String`
  # `java.lang.Integer`
  # `java.lang.Long`
  # `java.lang.Double`
  # `java.lang.Float`
  # `java.net.URI`

You should only annotate one field or one getter method with @Id.  Never mix and match method annotations with field annotations.  Use either field annotations or method annotations.

{{{
public class ExampleBean {
  @Id private int myid;
}
}}}

{{{
public class ExampleBean {
  private int myid;

  @Id
  public int getMyid() {return myid;}
  public void setMyid(int i) { myid=i;}
}
}}}
