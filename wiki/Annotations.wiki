== `@Id` ==
The only annotation required by Jenabean.  Place it on a field or getter method to indicate which property of your bean type is to be used as the beans identity.  If you are working with pre-existing OWL/RDF and are not in control of the URI's, your id type should be `java.net.URI`.  Jenabean supports the following id types (and their primitive equivalent)

  # `java.lang.String`
  # `java.lang.Integer`
  # `java.lang.Long`
  # `java.lang.Double`
  # `java.lang.Float`
