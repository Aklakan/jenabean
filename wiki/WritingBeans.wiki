Java developers have objects.  Jena has triples.  We need something to translate an object with one or more properties into a set of triples that loosely say the same thing.  The first step is to create an instance of `thewebsemantic.Bean2RDF`:

{{{
Bean2RDF writer = new Bean2RDF(myModel);
}}}

Jenabean attempts to be as non-intrusive as possible, however, it requires your bean to have an id field or method marked with the `@Id` annotation.

{{{
public void Customer {
  @Id private int customerId;
}
}}}
