#summary How to use SPARQL to load beans out of a jena model.

Jenabean can load a beans given a SPARQL query and a java type.  Your query must comply with a simple pattern by selecting a single subject "?s". 

{{{
SELECT ?s WHERE { ... }
}}}

It's also important that your query intentionaly return resources that are mappable to the desired type.  The easiest way to do this is sparql is add a type assertion:

{{{
SELECT ?s WHERE { 
   ?s a <http://test.bean/Man> . 
   ...
}
}}}

Once you've crafted your SPARQL query use `thewebsemantic.Sparql` to run the query and return a list of results.

{{{
String 	queryString = 
	"SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s a <http://test.bean/FatBean> }";
Collection<FatBean> result2 = Sparql.exec(m, FatBean.class, queryString);
}}}
