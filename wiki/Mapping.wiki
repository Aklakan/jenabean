#summary Jenabean only requires beans to have an id annotation, however, you probably want to map to specific ontology classes and properties...here's how.

OWL/RDF has classes.  Supposedly the ontology author gave the classnames some thought, like foaf:Person.  The easiest thing to do is to name your JavaBeans according to the ontology class they are bound to and use the `@Namespace` annotation...

{{{
@Namespace("http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/")
public class Person {
        // abreviated
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
}}}
