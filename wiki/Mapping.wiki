#summary Jenabean only requires beans to have an id annotation, however, you probably want to map to specific ontology classes and properties...here's how.

OWL/RDF has classes.  Supposedly the ontology author gave the classnames some thought, like foaf:Person.  The easiest thing to do is to name your JavaBeans according to the ontology class they are bound to and use the `@Namespace` annotation...

{{{
@Namespace("http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/")
public class Person {
        // abreviated
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
}}}

This will cause your bean to be saved as an instance of foaf:Person.  @Namespace applies to the entire class, therefore, the name property in the example will also go under the foaf namespace as foaf:name, a valid foaf property.  The idea here is brevity.  We control our classes and the names of our properties, so assuming we name things according to the ontology, we can save some key strokes.
